  "Phase 0->3 staged rollout -- the satellite-operator analog of
  `cloud-itonami-isic-6190`'s `telecom.phase` and `cloud-itonami-isic-
  6120`'s `wirelesstelecom.phase`.

    Phase 0  read-only        -- no writes, still governor-gated.
    Phase 1  assisted-intake  -- terminal intake allowed, every write
                                 needs human approval.
    Phase 2  assisted-verify  -- adds identity verification + ITU-
                                 coordination-dispute screening writes,
                                 still approval.
    Phase 3  supervised auto  -- governor-clean, high-confidence
                                 `:terminal/intake` (no capital risk
                                 yet) may auto-commit. `:actuation/
                                 provision-capacity`/`:actuation/
                                 suspend-service` NEVER auto-commit, at
                                 any phase.

  `:actuation/provision-capacity`/`:actuation/suspend-service` are
  deliberately ABSENT from every phase's `:auto` set, including phase
  3 -- a permanent structural fact, not a rollout milestone still to
  come. Provisioning real satellite capacity and suspending a real
  terminal's service are the two real-world legal acts this actor
  performs; both are always a human satellite operator's call.
  `satcom.governor`'s `:actuation/provision-capacity`/`:actuation/
  suspend-service` high-stakes gate enforces the same invariant
  independently -- two layers, not one, agree on this. `:coordination/
  screen` is likewise never auto-eligible, at any phase -- the same
  posture every sibling's screening op has. Phase 3's `:auto` set here
  has only ONE member (`:terminal/intake`) -- this domain has no
  separate no-capital-risk 'file' lifecycle distinct from the terminal
  record itself.")
